Nested-Pandas
=============

An extension of pandas for efficient representation of nested
associated datasets.

Nested-Pandas extends the `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ package with 
tooling and support for nested dataframes packed into values of top-level 
dataframe columns. `Pyarrow <https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/index.html>`_ 
is used internally to aid in scalability and performance.

Nested-Pandas allows data like this:

.. image:: ./intro_images/pandas_dfs.png
  :width: 400
  :align: center
  :alt: pandas dataframes

To instead be represented like this:

.. image:: ./intro_images/nestedframe_example.png
  :width: 300
  :align: center
  :alt: pandas dataframes

Where the nested data is represented as nested dataframes:

.. code-block:: python

   # Each row of "object_nf" now has it's own sub-dataframe of matched rows from "source_df"
   object_nf.loc[0]["nested_sources"]

.. image:: ./intro_images/loc_into_nested.png
  :width: 300
  :align: center
  :alt: pandas dataframes

Allowing powerful and straightforward operations, like:

.. code-block:: python

   # Compute the mean flux for each row of "object_nf"
   import numpy as np
   object_nf.reduce(np.mean, "nested_sources.flux")

.. image:: ./intro_images/reduce.png
  :width: 150
  :align: center
  :alt: pandas dataframes

Nested-Pandas is motivated by time-domain astronomy use cases, where we see
typically two levels of information, information about astronomical objects and
then an associated set of `N` measurements of those objects. Nested-Pandas offers
a performant and memory-efficient package for working with these types of datasets. 

Core advantages being:

* hierarchical column access
* efficient packing of nested information into inputs to custom user functions
* avoiding costly groupby operations
