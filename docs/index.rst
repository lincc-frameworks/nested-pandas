Nested-Pandas
=============

An extension of pandas for efficient representation of nested
associated datasets.

Nested-Pandas extends the `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ package with 
tooling and support for nested dataframes packed into values of top-level 
dataframe columns. `Pyarrow <https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/index.html>`_ 
is used internally to aid in scalability and performance.

Nested-Pandas is motivated by time-domain astronomy use cases, where we see
typically two levels of information, information about astronomical objects and
then an associated set of `N` measurements of those objects. Nested-Pandas offers
a performant and memory-efficient package for working with these types of datasets. 

Core advantages being:

* hierarchical column access
* efficient packing of nested information into inputs to custom user functions
* avoiding costly groupby operations
