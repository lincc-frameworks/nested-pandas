    "\n",
    "Nested-Pandas is tailored towards efficient analysis of nested data sets. This includes data that would normally be represented in a Pandas DataFrames with multiple rows needed to represent a single \"thing\" and therefor multiple columns whose values will be identical for that item.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a concrete example, consider an astronomical data set storing information about observations of physical objects, such as stars and galaxies. One way to represent this in Pandas is to create one row per observation with an ID column indicating to which physical object the observation corresponds. However this approach ends up repeating a lot of data over each observation of the same object such as its location on the sky (RA, dec), its classification, etc. Further any operations processing the data as time series requires the user to first perform a (potentially expensive) group-by operation."
